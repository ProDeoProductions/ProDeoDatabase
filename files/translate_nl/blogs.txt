Almost done! (1)
	{<p>I've been working behind the scenes last few days to update the site a newer look. I'm not fully done yet, and some more changes will come to make it such that feels finished.</p><p><br></p><p>The most important things are there now, the database can be viewed, timeline and familytrees are created and the worldmap is visible and working.</p><p><br></p><p>I just have a list of details that I want to work on, tiny things that had a lower priority. Also, feel free to send me any feedback, tips or advice! It's not perfect, but it's also not done yet as well..</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as I'm done with the website itself, I will continue to work on the database and try to fill in as many blanks as possible and make a clear overview of bible related things.<br></p>; 1; 2022-07-03T11:55:25.381Z}
Finally there.. (2)
	{<p>After months of hard work, some breaks in between and a lot of persistence, I think I'm finally content with the website.</p><p><br></p><p>It's still not done though! I still have to fill up the database with information and check if everything truly works as intended. But as far as I can see and have tested the website, it should be good. </p><p><br></p><p>Please let me know if you find anything that does not seem right! Error messages, typo's, misinformation etc! Your help is very much appreciated as I work on the database and try to help people get a better understanding of the Bible.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you for sticking with me<br></p><p><br></p>; 1; 2022-08-25T13:01:12.934Z}
